Static Python
#############

What is Static Python?
======================

Static Python is an experimental alternative bytecode compiler and set of
runtime extensions to CPython. It takes advantage of existing type
annotations in the code for increased efficiency at runtime. It heavily
leverages the Cinder JIT, and provides additional typing information to it,
allowing a lot of operations to run at native speed. For example, attribute
accesses for classes in Static Python are a single indexed load, because we
use slot-based instance layouts and can resolve the attribute offset at
compile time.

Static Python modules are just specialized Python modules, and can seamlessly
call into or be called from normal Python code.

Why do we need Static Python?
=============================

Static Python provides Cython level performance, with no added syntax or
build steps. It provides a safe set of tools to perform low level operations
such as integer/floating-point arithmetic without sacrificing on the memory
safety provided by Python.

It also performs runtime type checking to ensure the accuracy of type
annotations, which improves the developer experience of typed Python.

How does it work?
=================

Static Python is implemented as a bytecode compiler, which emits specialized
Python opcodes when it can determine the type of something at compile time.
Whenever it’s not possible to determine the type at compile time, it just
assumes the type to be dynamic, and falls back to normal Python behavior.

When the Cinder JIT sees the special opcodes, it further optimizes the
generated machine code. Consider this Python code::

    class C:
        def __init__(self) -> None:
            self.a: int = 1

    def fn(instance: C) -> int:
        return instance.a

In normal Python, `fn` is compiled to this bytecode::

    6           0 LOAD_FAST                0 (instance)
                2 LOAD_ATTR                0 (a)
                4 RETURN_VALUE

Here, `LOAD_ATTR` is a CPU bottleneck, because of the number of ways of
looking up Python attributes. Static Python however, knows that `a` is a
slot of class C, so it generates this bytecode instead::

    5           0 CHECK_ARGS               1 ((0, ('__main__', 'A')))

    6           2 LOAD_FAST                0 (instance)
                4 LOAD_FIELD               2 (('__main__', 'A', 'a'))
                6 RETURN_VALUE

With the static compiler, the `LOAD_ATTR` is now `LOAD_FIELD`. Within the
JIT, this is compiled to these three machine instructions::

    mov    0x10(%rdi),%rbx
    test   %rbx,%rbx
    je     0x7fc1d9836daa

Compared with the `standard Python attribute lookup`_, this is way faster!
The tradeoff is, we need to have the ``CHECK_ARGS`` in place, so that we only
look into the memory location when the type is correct. These checks are
extremely fast, and omitted when the caller function is also part of a Static
Python module.

I’m interested! How do I use it?
================================

Static Python is still under development, and there are a lot of rough edges.

Getting full benefit from Static Python (with cross-module compilation)
requires a module loader able to detect Static Python modules based on some
marker (we use the presence of ``import __static__``) and compile them using
the Static Python bytecode compiler. Such a module loader isn't yet part of
Cinder, but we plan to add one.

In the meantime, it is possible to try out the Static Python compiler by
running ``./python -m compiler --static somemod.py``. This will compile and
execute ``somemod.py`` as Static Python. Add ``--dis`` to also dump a
disassembly of the emitted bytecode, and add ``--strict`` to compile the
module as an immutable StrictModule, which enables some additional
optimizations. Add ``-X jit`` to also enable the Cinder JIT to get maximum
performance. You can also use ``-c --output somemod.pyc`` to output a
compiled ``.pyc`` file instead of executing the module.

``__static__`` imports reference
================================

You may see some unfamiliar imports from a new ``__static__`` module in
modules using Static Python. This reference should clarify their purpose.

``from __static__.compiler_flags import shadow_frame``
------------------------------------------------------

This is a “magic” import that signals to the Static Python compiler to enable
“shadow frame” mode in the Cinder JIT. This improves performance of function
calls by avoiding the creation of full Python frame objects until they are
definitely needed (e.g. if an exception is raised.) In the future this should
become default.

``from __static__ import cbool, int8, uint8, int16, uint16, int32, uint32, int64, uint64, double``
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These are primitive types, or C types. They can be used as type annotations in
Static Python modules to signal to the Cinder JIT that it can use unboxed C
types for these values. The static compiler automatically interprets literals
appropriately if in a primitive type context; e.g. ``x: cbool = True`` will
create a primitive boolean, not a Python ``True`` (despite the RHS appearing
to be Python ``True``), ``y: int64 = 3`` or ``int64(3)`` will create a
primitive ``int64`` with value ``3``, etc. (For literals, this happens in the
compiler, so at runtime we are not creating a boxed Python integer object and
then unboxing the value from it, we directly just create the primitive
value.) You can also at runtime unbox a Python object to a primitive value
with e.g. ``int64(some_python_int)``. This might raise ``TypeError`` at
runtime (if ``some_python_int`` is not actually an int), or it might raise
``OverflowError`` (if the python int is too large for the target primitive
size.)

Some things to know about primitives:

#. Performance will generally be better. Creation and reference counting and
   destruction of Python objects is inherently expensive, and all these costs
   can be eliminated. In particular arithmetic with primitive values (which can
   directly translate to assembly arithmetic instructions) will perform much
   better than arithmetic with dynamic Python objects.

#. Unlike Python’s numeric types, primitive ``intxx`` and ``double`` have
   limited bit width and can overflow, and you are responsible to avoid this,
   just as when writing C code. Currently overflow is undefined behavior
   (usually silent wraparound, in some cases ``OverflowError``); in the future
   we aim to make it always raise ``OverflowError``.

#. To avoid unnecessary creation of expensive Python objects in hot paths,
   comparing two primitives produces a ``cbool`` not a Python ``bool``. E.g. if
   ``x: int64 = 3`` and ``y: int64 = 4``, then after ``z = (x == y)``, ``z``
   will have type ``cbool``.

#. Primitive types cannot mix with Python types or with each other; their
   type must always be known exactly by the static compiler. The compiler will
   error if you ever try to have a value (even transiently) of ``Union`` type
   including a primitive type as part of the union. One notable case where this
   might bite you is due to primitive comparisons producing ``cbool`` and the
   short-circuiting behavior of Python’s ``and`` and ``or`` operators. This
   means that code such as ``a_prim == b_prim or x_py_int > y_py_int`` is
   illegal, because the first compare will produce a ``cbool`` and the second
   will produce a ``bool``, and the overall expression might produce either one
   depending whether the first compare is true or false. In such cases you must
   either explicitly box or unbox some of the compares so that the chain all
   produce the same type, or split it into separate (maybe nested) ``if``
   statements.

#. You can pass primitive types as arguments and return values in function
   calls within static Python. If a non-static function calls a Static Python
   function that takes primitive arguments, it can pass the Python equivalent
   type (``float`` for ``double``, ``int`` for ``[u]intxx``, ``bool`` for
   ``cbool``) and the value will be implicitly unboxed (possibly raising
   ``OverflowError``). Similarly, static Python functions returning primitive
   values to a non-static caller will implicitly box the value to the
   corresponding Python type.

#. You can index into lists, tuples etc using primitive integers. In the
   general case this is equivalent to ``l[box(an_int64)]`` but for actual
   builtin sequence types it is optimized in the JIT to avoid the creation of a
   Python int.

``from __static__ import box``
------------------------------

The ``__static__.box`` function explicitly converts a primitive value to the
corresponding Python type. E.g. ``x: int = box(an_int64)``, ``y: bool =
box(a_cbool)``, ``z: float = box(a_double)``.

``from __static__ import CheckedDict``
--------------------------------------

``__static__.CheckedDict`` is a Python dictionary that enforces the contained
types at runtime. E.g. if ``d: CheckedDict[int, str]`` then it will be a
runtime ``TypeError`` to place a non-int key or non-str value into ``d``.
Within static Python code this is unnecessary since the compiler will already
enforce correct types (and in fact we bypass the check in this case, so
there’s also no overhead.) But you can safely pass a ``CheckedDict`` out of
Static Python code and into normal Python code and if it is later passed back
into Static Python code, the static compiler will be able to trust that its
keys are definitely ints and its values definitely strings. (For normal
Python containers, which don’t do any runtime enforcement, Static Python
always treats their contents as of dynamic, unknown type.

(You may be wondering why ``CHECK_ARGS`` described above doesn’t fully
validate the contained types of e.g. a Python dict passed as an argument to a
Static Python function, so that we can trust them. The answer is that it’s
far too expensive to do this in general, since it is necessarily ``O(n)`` in
the size of the container.)

``from __static__ import Array, Vector``
----------------------------------------

``__static__.Array`` is a fixed-size contiguous array of primitive values, like a C array.
``__static__.Vector`` is similar but dynamically sized.

``from __static__ import clen``
-------------------------------

The ``__static__.clen`` function gets the ``len()`` of a Python object as a
primitive ``int64``. In the general case this is equivalent to
``int64(len(obj))``, but if ``obj`` is a builtin Python list, dictionary,
``__static__.CheckedDict``, ``__static__.Array``, or ``__static__.Vector``,
we are able to emit a much faster length check without ever creating a Python
``int``.

``from __static__ import inline``
---------------------------------

The ``@inline`` decorator allows the static compiler to inline a one-line
function directly into its (statically compiled) callers for efficiency.
Currently the function body must consist only of a single ``return``
statement.

``from __static__ import dynamic_return``
---------------------------------

The ``@dynamic_return`` decorator causes the static compiler to not trust the annotated
return type of a function. It is useful in cases where we intentionally lie about the return
type.

For example, if we return a weakref, or a lazily evaluated string translation. In these scenarios,
Static Python will try to ensure the returned object matches the annotation, but that'll fail. Using
`dynamic_return` is a workaround for such scenarios.


``from __static__ import cast``
-------------------------------

The ``__static__.cast()`` function is similar to ``typing.cast()`` in its
usage, but unlike ``typing.cast()`` it performs a runtime type check to
validate that the object is in fact of the type you are casting it to,
allowing the static compiler to trust that type. E.g. if ``x = cast(int,
some_non_static_function())``, then the static compiler will know that ``x``
is of type ``int``, even though it doesn’t know and cannot trust the return
type of ``some_non_static_function()``. If at runtime the function returns
something that is not an ``int``, the ``cast`` will raise ``TypeError``.

In most cases you shouldn’t need ``__static__.cast()``, because the compiler
can handle values of unknown type (it just treats them as dynamically typed
Python objects, same as Python normally would). If you use an object of
unknown type in a place where a specific type is required, the static
compiler will allow you to do so and will automatically insert a cast to the
needed type at that point.
